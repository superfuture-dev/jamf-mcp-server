A comprehensive MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that enables AI assistants to interact with Jamf Pro for complete Apple device management. Works with Claude Desktop and **ChatGPT** (via MCP Connectors).

**Two modes**: Classic Mode (115 individual tools) or **Code Mode** (2 tools + sandboxed JavaScript SDK)

### What's New in v2.2

- **Code Mode** — a new execution model that exposes just 2 MCP tools (`jamf_search` + `jamf_execute`) instead of 115 individual tools. The agent writes JavaScript that runs in a sandboxed `node:vm` context with a typed Jamf API client, enabling complex multi-step workflows in a single tool call. Includes capability-based access control, budget tracking, plan/apply workflow, and an approval gate for high-impact commands.
- **Concurrency limiting** — semaphore-style `ConcurrencyLimiter` (default 5, configurable via `JAMF_MAX_CONCURRENCY`) prevents 429 rate-limit errors. Applied to both the core API client and Code Mode sandbox.
- **Policy caching** — `getPolicyDetails` results are now cached to avoid redundant API calls, with automatic invalidation on policy writes.
- **Static computer group XML fix** — `createStaticComputerGroup` and `updateStaticComputerGroup` now use proper XML via `XmlBuilder` (with escaping) instead of broken JSON or raw template literals.

### What's in v2.1

- **115 tools** (up from 56) — expanded coverage across the full Jamf Pro API and Classic API
- **12 resources** — all returning live data including compliance, storage, OS versions, encryption, and patch reports
- **12 workflow prompts** — guided templates for common admin tasks like onboarding, offboarding, security audits, and staged rollouts
- **Compound tools** — single-call operations like `getFleetOverview`, `getDeviceFullProfile`, `getSecurityPosture`, and `getPolicyAnalysis` that combine multiple API calls behind the scenes
- **Bearer Token authentication on Classic API** — full OAuth2 Client Credentials support without needing a username/password
- **Parallel API calls** — batch operations and compound tools run requests concurrently for faster results
- **Correct Jamf terminology** — all documentation and tool descriptions align with official Jamf developer documentation

## Code Mode (New)

Code Mode replaces 115 individual MCP tools with just 2:

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `jamf_search` | Discover API methods — search by keyword, browse by category, view signatures and required capabilities |
| `jamf_execute` | Run JavaScript in a sandboxed VM with access to the full Jamf API client |

**Why Code Mode?** This implementation is inspired by [Cloudflare's Code Mode pattern](https://blog.cloudflare.com/code-mode-mcp/), which addresses a fundamental tension in MCP: agents need many tools to do useful work, but every tool definition consumes context window tokens. Cloudflare found that exposing their full API as individual MCP tools would consume over 1 million tokens — more than the entire context window of most models. Their solution: collapse everything into a `search` + `execute` pattern where agents discover APIs on demand and write code against a typed SDK, reducing token usage by up to 99.9%.

We applied the same pattern to Jamf Pro. Our 115 Classic Mode tools consume ~14,000 tokens of tool definitions. Code Mode reduces that to ~500 tokens (2 tool definitions) while retaining access to the full API surface. The agent uses `jamf_search` to discover methods, then writes JavaScript that runs in a sandboxed `node:vm` context. This also enables multi-step workflows in a single tool call — chaining API calls, filtering results, and building reports without LLM round-trips between each step.

**Safety features:**
- **Plan/Apply workflow** — run with `mode: "plan"` to preview all writes without executing, then `mode: "apply"` to commit
- **Capability-based access** — declare only the permissions your code needs (`read:computers`, `write:policies`, `command:mdm`, etc.)
- **Budget tracking** — automatic call-count limits prevent runaway loops
- **Approval gate** — high-impact commands (wipe, lock, delete) require an explicit approval token
- **Concurrency throttling** — API calls are rate-limited to prevent 429 errors

### Code Mode Configuration

Use `dist/index-code.js` as the entry point instead of `dist/index-main.js`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jamf-code": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/jamf-mcp-server/dist/index-code.js"],
      "env": {
        "JAMF_URL": "https://your-instance.jamfcloud.com",
        "JAMF_CLIENT_ID": "your-api-client-id",
        "JAMF_CLIENT_SECRET": "your-api-client-secret"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Code Mode Example

```javascript
// Find all computers not checked in for 30 days
const computers = await jamf.getAllComputers(200);
const stale = computers.filter(c => helpers.daysSince(c.lastContactTime) > 30);
log(`Found ${stale.length} stale computers`);
return stale.map(c => ({ id: c.id, name: c.name, lastContact: c.lastContactTime }));
```

### Code Mode vs Classic Mode Benchmark

Real numbers from a live Jamf Pro instance (`npm run benchmark`):

#### Tool Definition Overhead

Every conversation loads all tool definitions into the LLM's context window. Fewer tools = more room for actual work.

| Mode    | Tools | Def. Size (bytes) | Est. Tokens |
|---------|------:|--------------:|--------:|
| Classic |   115 |        55,639 |  13,910 |
| Code    |     2 |         1,963 |     491 |

Code Mode uses **28x fewer tokens** just for tool definitions.

#### Scenario Results

10 scenarios covering baseline parity, cross-domain joins, multi-source audits, and workflows that are impossible in Classic Mode:

| #  | Scenario                       | Mode    | LLM Trips | Time (ms) | Completable |
|---:|--------------------------------|---------|----------:|----------:|:-----------:|
|  1 | Single device lookup           | classic |         1 |       308 | Yes         |
|  1 | Single device lookup           | code    |         1 |       241 | Yes         |
|  2 | Device profile + policy logs   | classic |         1 |       276 | Yes         |
|  2 | Device profile + policy logs   | code    |         1 |       228 | Yes         |
|  3 | Orphaned scripts audit         | classic |         2 |       131 | Yes         |
|  3 | Orphaned scripts audit         | code    |         1 |       172 | Yes         |
|  4 | Policies targeting a group     | classic |         2 |       133 | Yes         |
|  4 | Policies targeting a group     | code    |         1 |     2,611 | Yes         |
|  5 | OS version by department       | classic |       N/A |       N/A | **No**      |
|  5 | OS version by department       | code    |         1 |     1,073 | Yes         |
|  6 | Full security audit            | classic |         4 |    62,945 | Yes         |
|  6 | Full security audit            | code    |         1 |     6,936 | Yes         |
|  7 | Policy comparison              | classic |         2 |       221 | Yes         |
|  7 | Policy comparison              | code    |         1 |       115 | Yes         |
|  8 | Stale devices + details (top 10) | classic |       1 |     1,017 | Yes         |
|  8 | Stale devices + details (top 10) | code    |       1 |         4 | Yes         |
|  9 | Package dependency audit       | classic |         1 |    15,639 | Yes         |
|  9 | Package dependency audit       | code    |         1 |    15,015 | Yes         |
| 10 | Group + FileVault + OS filter  | classic |       N/A |       N/A | **No**      |
| 10 | Group + FileVault + OS filter  | code    |         1 |       187 | Yes         |

**Code Mode: 10/10 completable. Classic Mode: 8/10.**

**Key takeaways:**

- **Tool definition overhead**: Classic Mode consumes ~14K tokens of context window just for tool definitions — before any work begins. Code Mode uses ~500 tokens.
- **Impossible workflows**: Scenarios 5 and 10 require cross-resource joins (OS version × department, group members × FileVault × OS filter) that Classic Mode simply cannot express in bounded tool calls.
- **Multi-step workflows**: Security audit (S6) drops from 4 sequential LLM round-trips to 1. Policy comparison (S7) drops from 2 to 1. Each saved round-trip eliminates seconds of LLM inference latency.
- **Cross-domain joins**: Orphaned scripts (S3), group-scoped policies (S4), and package dependencies (S9) each require fetching a list, then detail-fetching N items — a pattern that forces Classic Mode into N sequential LLM calls. Code Mode does it in 1.
- **Simple lookups**: Roughly equivalent. Classic's purpose-built tools have slightly less overhead for single-call operations.
- **Scaling note**: These results are from a small Jamf instance. On a production fleet with hundreds of policies and devices, Classic Mode trip counts for S3/S4/S8/S9 would reach 10–20+, pushing the average LLM round-trip reduction well above 80%.

Run the benchmark yourself:
```bash
npm run benchmark                        # all 10 scenarios
npm run benchmark -- --scenarios 1,5,10  # run a subset
# requires JAMF_URL, JAMF_CLIENT_ID, JAMF_CLIENT_SECRET
```

## Classic Mode (115 Tools)

## What You Can Do

Ask natural language questions about your Jamf fleet:
- "How is my fleet doing?" — uses `getFleetOverview` for a single-call summary
- "Tell me about LAPTOP-001" — uses `getDeviceFullProfile` to resolve by name, serial, or ID
- "What's our security posture?" — uses `getSecurityPosture` for encryption and compliance analysis
- "How is the Software Install policy performing?" — uses `getPolicyAnalysis` with auto-resolve by name
- "Find all devices that haven't checked in for 30 days"
- "Deploy software updates to the marketing team"
- "Retrieve the LAPS password for this device"
- "Show me patch compliance across the fleet"

## Architecture

```
                    ┌─ Classic Mode (110 tools) ──┐
Claude Desktop ──>  │  MCP Server (stdio)          │──>  Jamf Pro API
                    ├─ Code Mode (2 tools) ────────┤
                    │  jamf_search + jamf_execute   │──>  (sandboxed VM)  ──>  Jamf Pro API
                    └──────────────────────────────┘
ChatGPT ──>  Tunnel (Cloudflare) ──>  MCP Server (HTTP)  ──>  Jamf Pro API
```

The server uses a hybrid API client that supports both the Jamf Pro API and Classic API, with automatic fallback between them for maximum compatibility across Jamf Pro versions. All API calls pass through a concurrency limiter to prevent rate-limit errors.

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues
- Verify your API credentials (Client ID and Secret)
- Ensure the API client has the required permissions
- For Classic API endpoints, the server automatically uses Bearer Token authentication

### 503 Errors on Classic API
- If using Client Credentials only (no username/password), ensure you're running v2.1+ which supports Bearer Token authentication on Classic API endpoints

### Timeouts on Compound Tools
- The default request timeout is 30 seconds
- Compound tools like `getFleetOverview` make parallel API calls and may need more time on slower instances
